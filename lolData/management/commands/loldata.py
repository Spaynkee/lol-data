""" loldata.py

This script is the main script for the collection of data as part of
the loldat project. It creates instances of the LolAccount class for each of the accounts
we're collecting data from. It creates Instances of the Parser, gatherer, and logger
and updates our script_runs table when the script begins running, as well as  when it
finishes or fails.

Example:
    $ python3 loldata.py Manual
    $ python3 loldata.py Manual 3000
